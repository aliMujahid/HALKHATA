Name of the site: "HalKhata"

Site Goals: 
	Allow the user to Log daily Exercise, Food Intake, Spendings and 
	Coding projects.

Target Audience:
	Me

Use Case Senario:
	Upon opening the site on a browser I was prompted to enter my Password.
	After successfully varifing I navigated to the "Activity" page. I wanted to log 
	todays workout so I clicked on "+Log Today's Activity" and was taken to another
	page where I could select the type of my activity from a list. Upon selecting the
	type "Workout" an empty template appeared Where I could write names of individual
	exercises, set and reps per set; muscle sets that's been activated and duration of the 
	activity. I clicked the 'save' button and was redirected back to the "Activity" page
	where my newly saved activity appeard by date. 
	  I then navigated to the "Meals" page and it was showing my daily caloric intake
	on a graph. I clicked the "Add" button and a form appeared where I named the meal
	as "break fast" and selected some food items and entered their quantity. After saving 
	details about the meal appeared and I could see how much calorie, carbs, protien, and
	fat I took in.
	The "Spending" page was just a simple notepad, I had to do the calculations my self.
	And lastly in the "Coding" page there was a list of projects and in there I could note
	my proggress and other things about it.
